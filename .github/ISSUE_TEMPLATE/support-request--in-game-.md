Follow the Who-What-When-Where-Why-How-Suggestion paradigm.  Make sure your request specifies exactly each of the Ws.

This is for issues NOT requiring real-time assistance.  Do not report other players behaviors, chat, or anything that should be taken care of *right now*!  This should be handled with a request in-game from staff.  Specifically in this order, if each fails:
1) identify and talk to any staff on the server (use /help channel)
2) use the /helpop request system - this will send a message to ALL online staff. Be patient.
3) use the Minecats #help_and_support channel on Discordapp, tag @Staff
4) Provided no staff are online or reply at all, take screenshots to attach to this issue, and fill out the information below.

For ALL other in-game related issues, fill out the form and attach any images helpful to communicating the issue.
