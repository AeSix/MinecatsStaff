### Minecats Ban Appeal

# There are rules to filing a ban appeal:
1. Be respectful!  This includes being so towards the staff reading this, as well as yourself.
2. Know why you were banned.  If you honestly have no idea why you were banned, talk to the staff on Discord.  Asking your friend to ask staff will NOT be taken kindly. 
3. Understand that Minecats is a private community, welcoming all whom wish to abide by the rules, to have fun and allow others to have fun at no expense to anyone else.
4. We have rules for the community as well as the games. It is your responsibility to read, understand and follow these rules.
5. Your account is private to you, as such "you" refers to the living breathing person whom you are, as well as the account(s) you use.  This includes Minecraft, Discord, Github, etc.  
    5. Your accounts will be permanently banned if it was used with your permission to break our rules by another person. 
    5. Leaving your account unlocked is implicite permission. (This means "My little brother did it" is no excuse!)
    5. Your account may be unbanned provided you assure us all corrective steps have been taken. This includes password changes and auto-locking your computer.
6. Your appeal must be sincere and convey understanding.  If you fail to achieve this, your appeal will be denied.
7. Abuse of the github issues will result in your github account being blocked, and possibly being removed from other aspects of The Minecats Community. 
8. Appeals will be accepted for ONLY permanent ("indefinite") bans. Timed bans and "whitelisted server" are not appealable.
